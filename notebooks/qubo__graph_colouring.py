    ## Review

    Graph colouring (or vertex colouring) is the procedure of assigning colours to each vertex of a graph such that adjacent vertices receive different colours. The decision version asks:

    > Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $N$ nodes and a set of $K$ colours, is it possible to colour each vertex such that adjacent vertices receive different colours?

    Note that we aim to determine whether a feasible colouring exists using $K$ colours, rather than minimising the number of colours required. To find the minimum number of colours needed, we can solve the problem with decreasing values of $K$ until no feasible solution exists.

    ### Binary Variables

    We define $NK$ binary variables $x_{i,c}$, where $i$ represents the node and $c$ represents the colour:

    $$x_{i,c} = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if node } i \text{ is assigned colour } c \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$$

    for $i=0,\ldots,N-1$ and $c=0,\ldots,K-1$.

    ## Constraints

    The graph colouring problem involves two constraints:

    1. **Each node must be coloured using exactly one colour**
    2. **Adjacent nodes must be assigned different colours**

    Since we have no cost function to minimise, a feasible solution will yield an objective value of zero when constraints are satisfied. When no feasible solution exists, the objective value reflects the penalty terms from violated constraints.

    ## General Form of the $Q$ Matrix

    To construct the $Q$ matrix systematically, we need to examine the <span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps">qubo</span> formulation:

    $$\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left(1-\sum_{c=0}^{K-1}x_{i,c}\right)^2 + \sum_{(i,j) \in E} \sum_{c=0}^{K-1} x_{i,c}x_{j,c}$$

    **First term:** Each node must be coloured exactly once.

    - Each $x_{i,c}$ appears with coefficient $-1$
    - For each fixed $i$, all 2-combinations of $x_{i,c}$ appear with coefficient $+2$
    - Constant term: $N$

    **Second term:** Adjacent nodes must have different colours.

    - For each $(i,j) \in E$ and colour $c$, the term $x_{i,c} x_{j,c}$ appears with coefficient $+1$

    The $Q$ matrix rows and columns follow the ordering:
    $x_{0,0}, x_{0,1}, \ldots, x_{0,K-1}, x_{1,0}, x_{1,1}, \ldots, x_{1,K-1}, \ldots, x_{N-1,0}, x_{N-1,1}, \ldots, x_{N-1,K-1}$
